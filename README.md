# T8086

This is a repository for a soft CPU core compatible for Intel 8086. 8086 is a 16-bit microprocessor with 16-bit width registers, as well as internal and external data buses. The address space is addressed by means of internal memory "segmentation". A 20-bit external address bus provides a 1 MiB physical address space, programming over 64 KB memory boundaries involves adjusting the segment registers simply because internal address/index registers are only 16 bits wide. The data bus is multiplexed with the address bus in order to fit all of the control lines into a standard 40-pin dual in-line package.
